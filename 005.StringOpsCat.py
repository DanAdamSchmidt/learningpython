An introduction to built in string operations, concatenation

h = ''		# First let's make an empty string called 'h'. This can be
		# thought of as a container. Right now the container is empty.

h = "Hel"	# Now we have filled our container with a value. 
l = "lo"	# Let's make another container. Note: You do not need to 
		# declare the variable first!


word = h + l	# This process is called concatenation (concat for short), 
		# this would be like saying '1 + 1 = 11' or 'a + a = aa'
		# We are not adding, we are combining
		# Notice here that we can store variables inside one another

print word, "World!" 	# What are we doing here? We have just combined 
			# a string, and a variable. Sweet!
# There are many more string operations, but we will get back to that later.

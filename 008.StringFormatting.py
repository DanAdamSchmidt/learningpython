print "\n Okay enough with the Hello World! already.\n We need something different!\n" 
		# Notice how the '\n' does not print? It is actually a newline statement.
		# There are other types of statements like this.
		# \n = Newline
		# \\ = Backslash
		# \' = Single Quote
		# \" = Double Quote
		# \t = Horizontal Tab
		# In there are a few more, but these should suffice for now

"""My first Data Structure, a List!

"""
# A list can be considered a stack of information

MyFirstList = [66, 77, 82.2, 1, 120034]

# First let's see what happens when we print the list.

print MyFirstList

# Now let's print each item one at a time

for Number in MyFirstList:
	print Number

# ah much better. 
# We can also do more interesting things with the same for loop and the list
# like so:

# x = 0

# for Number in MyFirstList:
# 	x += Number 

# print x
